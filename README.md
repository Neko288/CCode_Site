## What is this site?
This is the my code introduction page.
## What is this code?
This is a python code that can create a cipher using Unicode.
It also allows you to decrypt the cipher you have created.
## How does it work?
It takes the characters you want to encrypt and turns them into Unicode values, combines them with any password, and then turns them back into characters again.
This is how you create a cipher.
